# tcp-simulator
I was trying to get my head around how TCP works so I wrote some pseudocode and then I relalised I might aswell write some actual code that I can run to check if I am correct

## Installation
### Prerequites
* Scala
* Scalac (optional)
## Process
0\. Download this repo (`git clone https://github.com/qwertpi/tcp-simulator.git`)  
1\. Either run as a script (`scala DESIREDPROGRAM.scala`) or compile (`scalac DESIREDPROGRAM.scala`) then run the compiled code (`scalac DESIREDPROGRAM`)
## Basic.scala
This is the simple simulation which I originaly wrote, simply press enter to advance the code when necacry
To run this either do `scala basic.scala` or `scalac basic.scala && scala basictcp`
## A.scala and B.scala
COMING SOON!  
If I ever get around to writing this, this will be two seperate programs which can be ran as two seprarte process on either the same computer or two different computers. This will probably stick all the TCP transimitions in a text file in a location where it can be read by both programs
